# Delta-V

Chicken Soup for the large data visualization's soul.

This framework simplifies some VERY difficult issues to address in handling graphics for
`large dynamic` visualizations.

## Installing

```sh
npm install -DE deltav
```

OR

```sh
yarn deltav
```

## Guide

This is the recommended reading for using this framework. More docs to come, but plenty to get you
rolling!

## Run Demos and modify the source code

Lots of demos available! Used to test and visualize the framework as development is executed on it!

```sh
npm run dev
```

Then visit http://localhost:8080

## Contributing

Make a PR. Make a very verbose description of what your changes accomplish.

You should probably file an issue as well for discussion and additional tracking.

Do NOT commit lock files.
