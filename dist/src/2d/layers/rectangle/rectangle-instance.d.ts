 * which is used to render to cards in the world for rendering. This is highly performant, but means:
 *
 * - Rectangles should only be so long.
 * - Multiline is not supported inherently
 * - Once a rectangle is constructed, only SOME properties can be altered thereafter
 *
 * A rectangle that is constructed can only have some properties set upon creating the rectangle and are locked
 * thereafter. The only way to modify them would be to destroy the rectangle, then construct a new rectangle
 * with the modifications. This has to deal with performance regarding rasterizing the rectangle
