     * The system is designed to automatically animate an item from it's current rendered location to the next location
     * seamlessly thus accounting for most situations. This method is provided to commit much more complex start, duration,
     * and delay animations within a given frame to prevent the need for complicated setTimeout patterns.

     * the rendering should be at the moment (complicated cpu methods within the IAutoEasingMethod used).
