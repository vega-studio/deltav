/**
 * This is a Buffer Management system that performs instancing via the uniforms available to the hardware.
 * This improves compatibility with instancing for systems DRAMATICALLY as ALL systems WILL support uniforms.
 * This will NOT perform the best against true hardware instancing support, but it will have edge cases where it
 * is needed.
 *
 * When a layer has too many instance + vertex attributes for the hardware, the system will defer to this buffer methodology.
 *
 * This class does a whoooooole lot of making the magical instancing optimization controls possible.
 *
 * Our instancing hackyness comes from the idea that uniforms are fast, and you don't have to commit
 * ALL of them when you touch just a little piece, and you don't have worry about drivers not supporting
 * partial vertex buffer updates.
 *
 * This also is WebGL 1.0 compatible without any extensions that are poorly implemented. And again: does
 * NOT require entire attribute buffer commits.
 *
 * Uniforms are limited for any given draw call. So we have to create multiple materials to support
 * chunks of the instances that need to be drawn. We then have to associate an instance with the set
 * of uniforms that is related to the instance and keep them paired together. If we have too many instances
 * we must generate more buffers to accomodate them.
 *
 * If we remove instances, we must free up the uniform set so that others can use the uniforms. While the uniforms
 * are not in use, the instance should not be rendering.
