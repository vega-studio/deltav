 * This class is an injected event manager for the surface, it specifically handles taking in mouse events intended for view interactions

 * mouse view locations and broadcast Instance interactions based on the interaction with the View the layer is a part of
 *
 * In Summary: This is an adapter that takes in interactions to the views and injects those events into the layers associated with
 * the views so that the layers can translate the events to gestures.
