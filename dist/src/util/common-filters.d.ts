 * When applied to a filter (eg - .filter(isDefined)), this will make the resulting array not have any FALSEY values.
 * This will also ensure the resulting TYPE of the array is not undefined or null. Thus:
 *
 * const test: (Type1 | Type2 | ... | undefined | null)[] = []
 * const notNull = test.filter(isDefined);
 *
 * notNull will now have a type that excludes undefined and null values.
 *
 * NOTE: The type correction seems to only work when you use this method DIRECTLY as a filter parameter
 * .filter(isDefined) Works!
 * .filter(val => isDefined(val)) Does NOT adjust typings!
 *
 * WARNING: This WILL filter out FALSEY values. So if values like 0 or '' is VALID, then beware.
